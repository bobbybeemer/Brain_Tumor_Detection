# Brain Tumor Detection

### Convolutional neural network developed using TensorFlow that classifies brain MRIs as healthy or tumorous

All data manipulation and model training was done in brain_tumor_detection.ipynb file using Google Colab. After training, the model was saved to brain_tumor_model.h5 and loaded into the interface.py file to allow for demos using Gradio.

Dataset: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/preetviradiya/brian-tumor-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/preetviradiya/brian-tumor-dataset)

Note: Run interface.py in command line so CTRL+C can be used to close server once demo is finished.
